This should be replaced by a description of the data reorganization you chose to implement and its effectiveness. Your description can be short, but should address the change made and why you expected a performance improvement. You should also include performance metrics to support wether runtime improved or not.

I parallelize the most outer for loop in the matrix_multiply function.
I gather the value in matrix B (B[i][j]) and turns it into the transpose of B (B[j][i]).
This data reorganization takes advantage of the data locality;
By accessing "horizontally" across one array instead reading "vertically" across multiple arrays,
it increases data locality and minimizes the access time.

The serialized version finishes order of 5000 multiplication in 77.187895 seconds at 3238.849820 mflops.
The reorganized parallelized version finishes order of 5000 multiplication in 43.292500 seconds at 5774.672317 mflops.
